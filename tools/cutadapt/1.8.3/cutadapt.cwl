        inputBinding:
          prefix: --adapter=
          separate: false
    inputBinding:
      position: 10
    doc: |
      Sequence of an adapter that was ligated to the 3` end.
      The adapter itself and anything that follows is
      trimmed. If the adapter sequence ends with the '$'
      character, the adapter is anchored to the end of the
      read and only found if it is a suffix of the read.

  front: # tested
    type:
      - "null"
      - type: array
        items: string
        inputBinding:
          prefix: --front==
          separate: false
    inputBinding:
      position: 10
    doc: |
      Sequence of an adapter that was ligated to the 5` end.
      If the adapter sequence starts with the character '^',
      the adapter is 'anchored'. An anchored adapter must
      appear in its entirety at the 5` end of the read (it
      is a prefix of the read). A non-anchored adapter may
      appear partially at the 5` end, or it may occur within
      the read. If it is found within a read, the sequence
      preceding the adapter is also trimmed. In all cases,
      the adapter itself is trimmed.

  anywhere: # tested
    type:
      - "null"
      - type: array
        items: string
        inputBinding:
          prefix: --anywhere==
          separate: false
    inputBinding:
      position: 10
    doc: |
      Sequence of an adapter that was ligated to the 5` or
      3` end. If the adapter is found within the read or
      overlapping the 3` end of the read, the behavior is
      the same as for the -a option. If the adapter overlaps
      the 5`` end (beginning of the read), the initial
      portion of the read matching the adapter is trimmed,
      but anything that follows is kept.

  errorRate: #tested
    type: float?
    inputBinding:
      position: 10
      prefix: --error-rate=
      separate: false

      Maximum allowed error rate (no. of errors divided by
      the length of the matching region) (default: 0.1)

  noIndels: #tested
    type: boolean?
    inputBinding:
      position: 10
      prefix: --no-indels
    doc: |
      Do not allow indels in the alignments (allow only
      mismatches). Currently only supported for anchored
      adapters. (default: allow both mismatches and indels)

  times: #tested
    type: int?
    inputBinding:
      position: 10
      prefix: --times=
      separate: false
    doc: |
      Try to remove adapters at most COUNT times. Useful
      when an adapter gets appended multiple times (default:1).

  overlap: #tested
    type: int?
    inputBinding:
      position: 10
      prefix: --overlap=
      separate: false
    doc: |
      Minimum overlap length. If the overlap between the
      read and the adapter is shorter than LENGTH, the read
      is not modified. This reduces the no. of bases trimmed
      purely due to short random adapter matches (default:3).

  matchReadWildcards: #tested
    type: boolean?
    inputBinding:
      position: 10

      Do not change negative quality values to zero.
      Colorspace quality values of -1 would appear as spaces
      in the output FASTQ file. Since many tools have

#cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads.
#
#Usage:
#    cutadapt -a ADAPTER [options] [-o output.fastq] input.fastq
#
#For paired-end reads:
#    cutadapt -a ADAPT1 -A ADAPT2 [options] -o out1.fastq -p out2.fastq in1.fastq in2.fastq
#
#Replace "ADAPTER" with the actual sequence of your 3' adapter. IUPAC wildcard
#characters are supported. The reverse complement is *not* automatically
#searched. All reads from input.fastq will be written to output.fastq with the
#adapter sequence removed. Adapter matching is error-tolerant. Multiple adapter
#sequences can be given (use further -a options), but only the best-matching
#adapter will be removed.
#
#Input may also be in FASTA format. Compressed input and output is supported and
#auto-detected from the file name (.gz, .xz, .bz2). Use the file name '-' for
#standard input/output. Without the -o option, output is sent to standard output.
#
#Some other available features are:
#  * Various other adapter types (5' adapters, "mixed" 5'/3' adapters etc.)
#  * Trimming a fixed number of bases
#  * Quality trimming
#  * Trimming colorspace reads
#  * Filtering reads by various criteria
#
#Use "cutadapt --help" to see all command-line options.

#                        preceding the adapter is also trimmed. In all cases,
#                        the adapter itself is trimmed.
#    -b ADAPTER, --anywhere=ADAPTER
#                        Sequence of an adapter that was ligated to the 5' or
#                        3' end. If the adapter is found within the read or
#                        overlapping the 3' end of the read, the behavior is
#                        the same as for the -a option. If the adapter overlaps
#                        the 5' end (beginning of the read), the initial
#                        portion of the read matching the adapter is trimmed,
#                        but anything that follows is kept.
#    -e ERROR_RATE, --error-rate=ERROR_RATE
#                        Maximum allowed error rate (no. of errors divided by
#                        the length of the matching region) (default: 0.1)
#    --no-indels         Do not allow indels in the alignments (allow only
#                        mismatches). Currently only supported for anchored
#                        adapters. (default: allow both mismatches and indels)
#    -n COUNT, --times=COUNT
#                        Try to remove adapters at most COUNT times. Useful
#                        when an adapter gets appended multiple times (default:
#                        1).
#    -O LENGTH, --overlap=LENGTH
#                        Minimum overlap length. If the overlap between the
#                        read and the adapter is shorter than LENGTH, the read
#                        is not modified. This reduces the no. of bases trimmed
#                        purely due to short random adapter matches (default:
#                        3).
#    --match-read-wildcards
#                        Allow IUPAC wildcards in reads (default: False).
#    -N, --no-match-adapter-wildcards
#                        Do not interpret IUPAC wildcards in adapters.
#
#  Options for filtering of processed reads:
#    --discard-trimmed, --discard
#                        Discard reads that contain the adapter instead of
#                        trimming them. Also use -O in order to avoid throwing
#                        away too many randomly matching reads!
#    --discard-untrimmed, --trimmed-only
#                        Discard reads that do not contain the adapter.
#    -m LENGTH, --minimum-length=LENGTH
#                        Discard trimmed reads that are shorter than LENGTH.
#                        Reads that are too short even before adapter removal
#                        are also discarded. In colorspace, an initial primer
#                        is not counted (default: 0).
#    -M LENGTH, --maximum-length=LENGTH
#                        Discard trimmed reads that are longer than LENGTH.
#                        Reads that are too long even before adapter removal
#                        are also discarded. In colorspace, an initial primer
#                        is not counted (default: no limit).
#    --no-trim           Match and redirect reads to output/untrimmed-output as
#                        usual, but do not remove adapters.
#    --max-n=LENGTH      The max proportion of N's allowed in a read. A number
#                        < 1 will be treated as a proportion while a number > 1
#                        will be treated as the maximum number of N's
#                        contained.
#    --mask-adapter      Mask adapters with 'N' characters instead of trimming
#                        them.
#
#  Options that influence what gets output to where:
#    --quiet             Do not print a report at the end.
#    -o FILE, --output=FILE
#                        Write modified reads to FILE. FASTQ or FASTA format is
#                        chosen depending on input. The summary report is sent
#                        to standard output. Use '{name}' in FILE to
#                        demultiplex reads into multiple files. (default:
#                        trimmed reads are written to standard output)
#    --info-file=FILE    Write information about each read and its adapter
#                        matches into FILE. See the documentation for the file
#                        format.
#    -r FILE, --rest-file=FILE
#                        When the adapter matches in the middle of a read,
#                        write the rest (after the adapter) into FILE.
#    --wildcard-file=FILE
#                        When the adapter has wildcard bases ('N's), write
#                        adapter bases matching wildcard positions to FILE.
#                        When there are indels in the alignment, this will
#                        often not be accurate.
#    --too-short-output=FILE
#                        Write reads that are too short (according to length
#                        specified by -m) to FILE. (default: discard reads)
#    --too-long-output=FILE
#                        Write reads that are too long (according to length
#                        specified by -M) to FILE. (default: discard reads)
#    --untrimmed-output=FILE
#                        Write reads that do not contain the adapter to FILE.
#                        (default: output to same file as trimmed reads)
#
#  Additional modifications to the reads:
#    -u LENGTH, --cut=LENGTH
#                        Remove LENGTH bases from the beginning or end of each
#                        read. If LENGTH is positive, the bases are removed
#                        from the beginning of each read. If LENGTH is
#                        negative, the bases are removed from the end of each
#                        read. This option can be specified twice if the
#                        LENGTHs have different signs.
#    -q [5'CUTOFF,]3'CUTOFF, --quality-cutoff=[5'CUTOFF,]3'CUTOFF
#                        Trim low-quality bases from 5' and/or 3' ends of reads
#                        before adapter removal. If one value is given, only
#                        the 3' end is trimmed. If two comma-separated cutoffs
#                        are given, the 5' end is trimmed with the first
#                        cutoff, the 3' end with the second. The algorithm is
#                        the same as the one used by BWA (see documentation).
#                        (default: no trimming)
#    --quality-base=QUALITY_BASE
#                        Assume that quality values are encoded as
#                        ascii(quality + QUALITY_BASE). The default (33) is
#                        usually correct, except for reads produced by some
#                        versions of the Illumina pipeline, where this should
#                        be set to 64. (Default: 33)
#    --trim-n            Trim N's on ends of reads.
#    -x PREFIX, --prefix=PREFIX
#                        Add this prefix to read names
#    -y SUFFIX, --suffix=SUFFIX
#                        Add this suffix to read names
#    --strip-suffix=STRIP_SUFFIX
#                        Remove this suffix from read names if present. Can be
#                        given multiple times.
#    -c, --colorspace    Colorspace mode: Also trim the color that is adjacent
#                        to the found adapter.
#    -d, --double-encode
#                        When in colorspace, double-encode colors (map
#                        0,1,2,3,4 to A,C,G,T,N).
#    -t, --trim-primer   When in colorspace, trim primer base and the first
#                        color (which is the transition to the first
#                        nucleotide)
#    --strip-f3          For colorspace: Strip the _F3 suffix of read names
#    --maq, --bwa        MAQ- and BWA-compatible colorspace output. This
#                        enables -c, -d, -t, --strip-f3 and -y '/1'.
#    --length-tag=TAG    Search for TAG followed by a decimal number in the
#                        description field of the read. Replace the decimal
#                        number with the correct length of the trimmed read.
#                        For example, use --length-tag 'length=' to correct
#                        fields like 'length=123'.
#    --no-zero-cap       Do not change negative quality values to zero.
#                        Colorspace quality values of -1 would appear as spaces
#                        in the output FASTQ file. Since many tools have
#                        problems with that, negative qualities are converted
#                        to zero when trimming colorspace data. Use this option
#                        to keep negative qualities.
#    -z, --zero-cap      Change negative quality values to zero. This is
#                        enabled by default when -c/--colorspace is also
#                        enabled. Use the above option to disable it.
#
#  Paired-end options.:
#    The -A/-G/-B/-U options work like their -a/-b/-g/-u counterparts.
#
#    -A ADAPTER          3' adapter to be removed from the second read in a
#                        pair.
#    -G ADAPTER          5' adapter to be removed from the second read in a
#                        pair.
#    -B ADAPTER          5'/3 adapter to be removed from the second read in a
#                        pair.
#    -U LENGTH           Remove LENGTH bases from the beginning or end of each
#                        read (see --cut).
#    -p FILE, --paired-output=FILE
#                        Write second read in a pair to FILE.
#    --untrimmed-paired-output=FILE
#                        Write the second read in a pair to this FILE when no
#                        adapter was found in the first read. Use this option
#                        together with --untrimmed-output when trimming paired-
#                        end reads. (Default: output to same file as trimmed
#                        reads.)
