  ### Optional Inputs ###
  rename: #tested
    type: boolean?
    inputBinding:
      position: 1
      prefix: -r
    doc: |
      Rename sequence identifiers to numbers.

  keepUnknown: #tested
    type: boolean?
    inputBinding:
      position: 2
      prefix: -n

    type: boolean?
    inputBinding:
      position: 3
      prefix: -v
    doc: |
      Verbose - report number of sequences.
      If [-o] is specified,  report will be printed to STDOUT.
      If [-o] is not specified (and output goes to STDOUT),
      report will be printed to STDERR.

  compress: # TODO: runs through but cant be decompressed
    type: boolean?
    inputBinding:
      position: 4
      prefix: -z

      prefix: -Q33
    doc: |
      Make the most qualities readable

  ### Necessary Inputs ###
  inputFile: #tested
    type: File
    inputBinding:
      position: 5
      prefix: -i
    doc: |
      FASTAQ input file.

  targetFileName: #tested       #drawback: outPath must be relative, prefix is location of cwl tool
    type: string
    doc: |
      Name of the outputfile. Given as String.

                    Default is to discard such sequences.
    [-v]         = Verbose - report number of sequences.
                    If [-o] is specified,  report will be printed to STDOUT.
                    If [-o] is not specified (and output goes to STDOUT),
                    report will be printed to STDERR.
    [-z]         = Compress output with GZIP.
    [-i INFILE]  = FASTA/Q input file. default is STDIN.
    [-o OUTFILE] = FASTA output file. default is STDOUT.
